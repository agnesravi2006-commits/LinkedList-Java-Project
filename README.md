## ðŸš€ Features

- Singly Linked List implementation  
- Add node (at head, tail, or specific position)  
- Delete node (by value or position)  
- Search for a node  
- Display all nodes  
- Fully commented and easy to understand

## ðŸ§© Project Structure


- **Node.java** â†’ Represents a single node in the linked list  
- **LinkedList.java** â†’ Contains all core linked list operations  
- **Main.java** â†’ Demonstrates usage of the linked list

## ðŸ§  Example Code

```java
// Node.java
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
